# Marketing-and-regression

In this project, you will utilize multiple linear regression and estimate the linear relationship between one continuous dependent variable and two or more independent variables. You will be presented with a business scenario and a dataset to use as you explore multiple linear regression. You will practice applying a fitting multiple linear regression model and checking model assumptions to interpret model outputs and communicate to non-technical stakeholders
